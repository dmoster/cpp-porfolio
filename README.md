# C++ Portfolio

This repository includes .cpp and .h files for several C++ projects completed over the course of a programming class at Brigham Young University.

Take a look at the [plinko](https://github.com/dmoster/cpp-porfolio/tree/plinko), [shopping-cart](https://github.com/dmoster/cpp-porfolio/tree/shopping-cart), and [playlist](https://github.com/dmoster/cpp-porfolio/tree/playlist) branches to look at the individual projects.
