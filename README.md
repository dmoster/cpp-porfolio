# C++ Portfolio

This repository includes .cpp and .h files for several C++ projects completed over the course of a programming class at Brigham Young University.

Take a look at the plinko, [shopping-cart](https://github.com/dmoster/cpp-porfolio/tree/shopping-cart), and playlist branches to look at the individual projects.
